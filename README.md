# The project:
"The ducks at the park are free to take" is an exploratory data analysis project authored by John Nobles, Adam Gullion, and Jonathan Aguilar, which explores relationships in MLB pitching and hitting statistics from [statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/), investigates trends in these statistics, and attempts to explain the effects of Spider Tack and statcast on the MLB as a whole.
